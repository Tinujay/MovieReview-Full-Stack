# MovieReview-Full-Stack

Movie Review App - Cinema Central:

This is a web application that allows users to browse, add and review movies. The inspiration for this project was to create a platform for movie lover users to share their thoughts and opinions on different movies.

The application is built using Node.js and Express.js on the backend, and uses MongoDB as the database. Users can add a movie of their choice, view movie details including reviews, and leave their own reviews. The front-end of the application is using express-react-views, which allows you to render React components on the server-side and send them as HTML to the client. The application also includes a RESTful API for retrieving and manipulating movie and review data.

Features:
    - Browse movies - displayed in alphabetical order. 
    - Add your own movie to your index list
    - Edit / make changes to the movie you added 
    - View details about a specific movie, including plot, genre, and its ratings.
    - Write and submit reviews for movies
    - Delete reviews
    - Average calculation for each movie based upon the rating 

Technologies Used:
    - Node.js: for executing server-side code
    - Express.js: web application framework used for creating RESTful APIs and web applications
    - Express React Views to render my React components and served them as HTML to the client.
    - MongoDB: a NoSQL database used for storing data in a JSON-like format
    - Mongoose: an object data modeling (ODM) library used to interact with MongoDB through Node.js
    - HTML/CSS: used for the front-end interface and styling
    - JavaScript: used for client-side interactions and some server-side logic.
